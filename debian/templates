Description: Should apt-listchanges be automatically run by apt?
 One way to use apt-listchanges is to configure apt to run apt-listchanges on
 packages that have been downloaded for installation or upgrade.  This way,
 each time you perform an installation or upgrade using apt,
 apt-listchanges will show you the changes that are about to be made
 to your system.
 .
 I can perform this configuration for you if you like.  Since you can also run
 apt-listchanges manually on .deb archives, this step is optional.
