Template: apt-listchanges/frontend
Type: select
Choices: pager, xterm-pager, text, mail, none
Default: pager
Description: How should changelogs be displayed with apt?
 apt-listchanges can display changelog entries in a number of different ways.
 .
 pager - Use your preferred pager
 .
 xterm-pager - Use your preferred pager in an xterm in the background
 .
 text  - Print changelogs to your terminal (without pausing)
 .
 mail  - Only send changelogs via mail
 .
 none  - Do not run automatically from apt
 .
 This setting can be overridden by a command-line option or an
 environment variable.  Note that you can still send a copy via mail
 with all of the frontends except 'none'.

Template: apt-listchanges/email-address
Type: string
Default: root
Description: To whom should apt-listchanges mail changelog entries?
 apt-listchanges can email a copy of displayed changelogs.  To what
 email address should they be sent?  Specify "none" if no email should
 be sent.

Template: apt-listchanges/confirm
Type: boolean
Default: true
Description: Should apt-listchanges prompt for confirmation after displaying changelogs?
 After giving you a chance to display changelog entries,
 apt-listchanges can ask whether or not you would like to continue.
 This is useful when running from apt, as it gives you a chance to
 abort the upgrade if you see a change you do not want to apply (yet).
 .
 This setting only applies when running from apt.  Otherwise, it can be
 requested with a command line option.

Template: apt-listchanges/overwrite_etc_apt_listchanges_conf
Type: boolean
Default: true
Description: Should apt-listchanges overwrite your /etc/apt/listchanges.conf?
 apt-listchanges can configure all of the options in
 /etc/apt/listchanges.conf by asking you questions.  This file is read
 and processed every time apt-listchanges is run, and is used to set
 defaults.  All of the options can be overridden on the command line.
 .
 If you want to edit /etc/apt/listchanges.conf manually for whatever
 reason, answer "no" now.

Template: apt-listchanges/save-seen
Type: boolean
Default: true
Description: Should apt-listchanges skip changelogs that have already been seen?
 apt-listchanges has the capability to keep track of which changelog
 entries have already been displayed, and to skip them in future invocations.
 This is useful, for example, when retrying an upgrade.
