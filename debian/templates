Template: apt-listchanges/frontend
Type: select
_Choices: pager, browser, xterm-pager, xterm-browser, text, mail, none
Default: pager
_Description: How should changes be displayed with apt?
 apt-listchanges can display package changes in a number of different
 ways.
 .
 pager - Use your preferred pager to display changes one page at a time
 .
 browser - Display HTML-formatted changes using a web browser
 .
 xterm-pager - Like pager, but in an xterm in the background
 .
 xterm-browser - Like browser, but in an xterm in the background
 .
 text  - Print changes to your terminal (without pausing)
 .
 mail  - Only send changes via mail
 .
 none  - Do not run automatically from apt
 .
 This setting can be overridden by a command-line option or an environment
 variable.  Note that you can still send a copy via mail with all of the
 frontends except 'none'.

Template: apt-listchanges/email-address
Type: string
_Default: root
_Description: To whom should apt-listchanges mail changes?
 apt-listchanges can email a copy of displayed changes.  To what email
 address should they be sent?
 .
 Multiple addresses may be specified, delimited by commas.  Leave this
 empty if you do not want any email to be sent.

Template: apt-listchanges/confirm
Type: boolean
Default: false
_Description: Should apt-listchanges prompt for confirmation after displaying changes?
 After giving you a chance to read the list of changes, apt-listchanges
 can ask whether or not you would like to continue. This is useful when
 running from apt, as it gives you a chance to abort the upgrade if you see
 a change you do not want to apply (yet).
 .
 This setting does not apply to the 'mail' or 'none' frontends, and can be
 overridden with a command line option.

Template: apt-listchanges/save-seen
Type: boolean
Default: true
_Description: Should apt-listchanges skip changes that have already been seen?
 apt-listchanges has the capability to keep track of which changes
 have already been displayed, and to skip them in future
 invocations. This is useful, for example, when retrying an upgrade.

Template: apt-listchanges/which
Type: select
_Choices: news, both, changelogs
Default: news
_Description: Which types of changes should be displayed with apt?
  news - important news items only
  both - both news and detailed changelogs
  changelogs - detailed changelogs only
