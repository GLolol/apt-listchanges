Template: apt-listchanges/apt-hook-p
Type: boolean
Default: true
Description: Should apt-listchanges be automatically run by apt?
 One way to use apt-listchanges is to configure apt to run apt-listchanges on
 packages that have been downloaded for installation or upgrade.  This way,
 each time you perform an installation or upgrade using apt,
 apt-listchanges will show you the changes that are about to be made
 to your system.
 .
 I can perform this configuration for you if you like.  Since you can also run
 apt-listchanges manually on .deb archives, this step is optional.

Template: apt-listchanges/frontend
Type: select
Choices: pager, xterm-pager, newt, text, mail
Default: pager
Description: How should changelogs be displayed by default?
 apt-listchanges can display changelog entries in a number of different ways.
 .
 pager - Use your preferred pager
 .
 xterm-pager - Use your preferred pager in an xterm in the background
 .
 newt - Use a terminal graphics interface, using text-mode windows
 (you will need to install libnewt-perl to use this)
 .
 text  - Print changelogs to your terminal (without pausing)
 .
 mail  - Send changelogs via email (you will be prompted for an address)
 .
 This setting can be overridden by a command-line option.

Template: apt-listchanges/email-address
Type: string
Default: root
Description: To whom should apt-listchanges mail changelog entries?
 You have chosen to have changelog entries sent via email.  To what email
 address should they be sent?

Template: apt-listchanges/confirm
Type: boolean
Default: true
Description: Should apt-listchanges prompt for confirmation after displaying changelogs?
 After giving you a chance to display changelog entries,
 apt-listchanges can ask whether or not you would like to continue.
 This is useful when running from apt, as it gives you a chance to
 abort the upgrade if you see a change you do not want to apply (yet).
 .
 This setting only applies when running from apt.  Otherwise, it can be
 requested with a command line option.
