Template: apt-listchanges/frontend
Type: select
_Choices: pager, browser, xterm-pager, xterm-browser, text, mail, none
Default: pager
_Description: How should changelogs be displayed with apt?
 apt-listchanges can display changelog entries in a number of different
 ways.
 .
 pager - Use your preferred pager
 .
 browser - Display HTML-formatted changelogs using a web browser
 .
 xterm-pager - Like pager, but in an xterm in the background
 .
 xterm-browser - Like browser, but in an xterm in the background
 .
 text  - Print changelogs to your terminal (without pausing)
 .
 mail  - Only send changelogs via mail
 .
 none  - Do not run automatically from apt
 .
 This setting can be overridden by a command-line option or an environment
 variable.  Note that you can still send a copy via mail with all of the
 frontends except 'none'.

Template: apt-listchanges/email-address
Type: string
_Default: root
_Description: To whom should apt-listchanges mail changelog entries?
 apt-listchanges can email a copy of displayed changelogs.  To what email
 address should they be sent?
 .
 Multiple addresses may be specified, delimited by commas.  Leave this
 empty if you do not want any email to be sent.

Template: apt-listchanges/confirm
Type: boolean
Default: true
_Description: Should apt-listchanges prompt for confirmation after displaying changelogs?
 After giving you a chance to display changelog entries, apt-listchanges
 can ask whether or not you would like to continue. This is useful when
 running from apt, as it gives you a chance to abort the upgrade if you see
 a change you do not want to apply (yet).
 .
 This setting does not apply to the 'mail' or 'none' frontends, and can be
 overridden with a command line option.

Template: apt-listchanges/save-seen
Type: boolean
Default: true
_Description: Should apt-listchanges skip changelogs that have already been seen?
 apt-listchanges has the capability to keep track of which changelog
 entries have already been displayed, and to skip them in future
 invocations. This is useful, for example, when retrying an upgrade.
