apt-listchanges (1.35) unstable; urgency=low

  * Added Galician translation of message catalogs, thanks to Jacobo
    Tarrio <jtarrio@iname.com>
  * Modify apt.conf snippet to sanitize the exit code, so we don't cause
    apt to abort unless we really want to. (Closes: #88784)

apt-listchanges (1.34) unstable; urgency=low

  * We now interface with apt by dropping a conffile in
    /etc/apt/apt.conf.d.  This allows us to avoid sharing a config file
    with anyone else, and to have a defined execution order in relation
    to, e.g. dpkg-preconfigure.
  * debian/control: depend on apt (>= 0.5.3)
  * debian/control: depend on debconf (this should have been there long
    ago)
  * debian/rules: install /etc/apt/apt.conf.d/20-apt-listchanges.conf
  * debian/postinst: updated for apt 0.5 (no more apt.conf hackery!)
  * debian/postinst: added apt-mode-run config option, necessary for the
    new way of interfacing with apt
  * apt-listchanges.in: added apt-mode-run config option
  * Added Spanish translation of message catalogs, thanks to Jordi Mallach
    <jordi@debian.org>
  * apt-listchanges.sgml: Clarify the meaning of the --apt option

apt-listchanges (1.33) unstable; urgency=low

  * Depend on liblocale-gettext-perl (I forgot to commit this change along
    with the i18n changes in 1.32 (Closes: #85751, #85780)

 -- Matt Zimmerman <mdz@debian.org>  Mon, 12 Feb 2001 23:13:08 -0500

apt-listchanges (1.32) unstable; urgency=low

  * apt-listchanges is now internationalized.  New catalogs can be added
    in the po/ directory.  Translations are welcome. (Closes: #85432)
  * The build system has been reworked to use automake, for easier
    integration with gettext

 -- Matt Zimmerman <mdz@debian.org>  Mon, 12 Feb 2001 01:59:10 -0500

apt-listchanges (1.31) unstable; urgency=low

  * Finnish translation of debconf templates, thanks to Jaakko Kangasharju

 -- Matt Zimmerman <mdz@debian.org>  Fri,  9 Feb 2001 17:20:54 -0500

apt-listchanges (1.30) unstable; urgency=low

  * Added Korean translation of debconf templates, thanks to Eungkyu Song

 -- Matt Zimmerman <mdz@debian.org>  Sat,  3 Feb 2001 01:03:03 -0500

apt-listchanges (1.29) unstable; urgency=low

    Mallach <jordi@debian.org>

 -- Matt Zimmerman <mdz@debian.org>  Thu,  1 Feb 2001 02:36:33 -0500

apt-listchanges (1.28) unstable; urgency=low

    J. Zeeman" <tjzeeman@cs.vu.nl> (Closes: #83947)

 -- Matt Zimmerman <mdz@debian.org>  Sun, 28 Jan 2001 18:23:26 -0500

apt-listchanges (1.27) unstable; urgency=low

  * Added French translation of debconf templates, thanks to Thomas Morin
    <thomas.morin@webmotion.com> (Closes: #83799)

 -- Matt Zimmerman <mdz@debian.org>  Sun, 28 Jan 2001 00:09:34 -0500

apt-listchanges (1.26) unstable; urgency=low

  * Fixed a bug in the urgency sorting code; some higher-priority entries
    would incorrectly be sorted equal to low-priority entries

 -- Matt Zimmerman <mdz@debian.org>  Fri, 26 Jan 2001 14:28:59 -0500

apt-listchanges (1.25) unstable; urgency=low

    Dahlqvist <anedah-9@sm.luth.se>
  * Added German translation of debconf templates, thanks to Leonard
    Michlmayr <Leonard.Michlmayr@ap.univie.ac.at>

 -- Matt Zimmerman <mdz@debian.org>  Thu, 25 Jan 2001 00:28:11 -0500

apt-listchanges (1.24) unstable; urgency=low

  * Added -a/--all option, which ignores version checks and just dumps the
    entire changelog (Closes: #82225)
  * Prompt whether or not to overwrite an existing
    /etc/apt/listchanges.conf (Closes: #80983)

 -- Matt Zimmerman <mdz@debian.org>  Thu, 18 Jan 2001 17:38:11 -0500

apt-listchanges (1.23) unstable; urgency=low

  * Handle packages with different binary/source versions correctly
    (Closes: #82222)
  * Use Build-Depends-Indep rather than Build-Depends

 -- Matt Zimmerman <mdz@debian.org>  Sun, 14 Jan 2001 18:01:49 -0500

apt-listchanges (1.22) unstable; urgency=low

  * Handle apt-mode-confirm=no correctly (Closes: #81026)

 -- Matt Zimmerman <mdz@debian.org>  Wed,  3 Jan 2001 22:44:41 -0500

apt-listchanges (1.21) unstable; urgency=low

  * Added xterm-pager frontend, which starts an xterm in the background to
    display changes (Closes: #78662)

 -- Matt Zimmerman <mdz@debian.org>  Mon, 25 Dec 2000 21:16:05 -0500

apt-listchanges (1.20) unstable; urgency=low

  * Fall back from more complex to less complex frontends when
    initialization fails (Closes: #80477)

 -- Matt Zimmerman <mdz@debian.org>  Mon, 25 Dec 2000 20:23:51 -0500

apt-listchanges (1.19) unstable; urgency=low

  * Change the name and meaning of the config file variable 'confirm' so
    that it only applies to apt mode.  A config file default for this
    doesn't make sense when running from the command line.(Closes: #80082)
  * Clean up old debconf questions that we don't ask anymore

 -- Matt Zimmerman <mdz@debian.org>  Tue, 19 Dec 2000 23:15:38 -0500

apt-listchanges (1.18) unstable; urgency=low

  * Clarify and extend man page (Closes: #79698)

 -- Matt Zimmerman <mdz@debian.org>  Tue, 19 Dec 2000 00:58:08 -0500

apt-listchanges (1.17) unstable; urgency=low

  * Only ask for confirmation if there were changes to display

 -- Matt Zimmerman <mdz@debian.org>  Wed, 13 Dec 2000 16:58:27 -0500

apt-listchanges (1.16) unstable; urgency=low

  * Fix bug that caused apt-listchanges to run if no packages were being
    installed, only removed (Closes: #79479)

 -- Matt Zimmerman <mdz@debian.org>  Tue, 12 Dec 2000 19:03:06 -0500

apt-listchanges (1.15) unstable; urgency=low

  * All interactive frontends now have the option of asking the user
    whether or not to continue, in a way appropriate for the selected
    frontend.  Right now, this is a simple text prompt for all of them.
    (Closes: #78552)
  * Configuration file moved to /etc/apt/listchanges.conf
  * Renamed debconf variables to suit their actual use (which turned out
    to be different from their intended one).  This will cause all
    questions to get asked again, but since there is a new question to ask
    anyway, nobody should mind too much.
  * Some support for the new apt (0.4), which gives us a lot more information
    in the pipeline in addition to the .deb filenames.  This means that we
    won't have to read the status file anymore.  There is also a newer and
    better way to configure our hook into apt, but we can't use it until
    there is a new released version of apt to Depend on.

 -- Matt Zimmerman <mdz@debian.org>  Sun, 10 Dec 2000 00:22:12 -0500

apt-listchanges (1.14) unstable; urgency=low

  * Only skip based on the source package name if we actually got changelogs
    from another binary package with the same source package.  This fixes
    a problem when processing multi-binary packages which symlink
    subdirectories in /usr/share/doc (e.g. xmms/xmms-dev).

 -- Matt Zimmerman <mdz@debian.org>  Thu, 30 Nov 2000 04:56:49 -0500

apt-listchanges (1.13) unstable; urgency=low

  * Don't send empty messages when using the mail frontend (Closes: #77993)

 -- Matt Zimmerman <mdz@debian.org>  Mon, 27 Nov 2000 14:37:22 -0500

apt-listchanges (1.12) unstable; urgency=low

  * Make newt optional.  We only load it if the user is using the newt
    frontend, and fail with an informative message if it's unavailable.
    This also means we now Suggest newt, rather than depending on it, and
    it is no longer the default in debconf.  All you pager users can purge
    libnewt-perl and libnewt0 now.
  * Include the hostname when using the mail frontend (Closes: #77588)

 -- Matt Zimmerman <mdz@debian.org>  Tue, 21 Nov 2000 00:01:15 -0500

apt-listchanges (1.11) unstable; urgency=low

  * Always ignore the return value of the pager program...it's too
    unpredictable to use for making a decision.  I would like for the user
    to have some way to tell apt-listchanges to abort when using the pager
    frontend, but I'll have to find another way.  Once again, this
    hopefully Closes: #77421.
  * The patch to order changelog entries by urgency slipped out of 1.10.
    The functionality should be there now (Closes: #77420)

 -- Matt Zimmerman <mdz@debian.org>  Mon, 20 Nov 2000 19:58:12 -0500

apt-listchanges (1.10) unstable; urgency=low

  * Order changelog entries by urgency (Closes: #77420)

 -- Matt Zimmerman <mdz@debian.org>  Sun, 19 Nov 2000 04:21:16 -0500

apt-listchanges (1.9) unstable; urgency=low

  * Remember to catch SIGPIPE when using the pager frontend
    (Closes: #77421)

 -- Matt Zimmerman <mdz@debian.org>  Sun, 19 Nov 2000 03:40:24 -0500

apt-listchanges (1.8) unstable; urgency=low

  * Documented frontend and email-address options in manpage, corrected
    program name in manpage.

 -- Matt Zimmerman <mdz@debian.org>  Sat, 18 Nov 2000 04:46:52 -0500

apt-listchanges (1.7) unstable; urgency=low

  * Multiple frontend support added.  You can now choose to view
    changelogs with a pager, a simple text dump, via email, or with the
    old newt interface (Closes: #77186)
  * Remember to include the TODO list (oops)

 -- Matt Zimmerman <mdz@debian.org>  Sat, 18 Nov 2000 00:10:12 -0500

apt-listchanges (1.6) unstable; urgency=low

  * Remember to remove ourselves from apt.conf if we are reconfigured
    using dpkg-reconfigure
  * Resize ourselves properly (Closes: #77236)

 -- Matt Zimmerman <mdz@debian.org>  Thu, 16 Nov 2000 18:12:31 -0500

apt-listchanges (1.5) unstable; urgency=low

  * Fixed a bug that would read the wrong changelog for Debian
    native packages (notably dpkg) which have both a changelog.gz and
    changelog.Debian.gz.
  * Use only one piece of whitespace to indent the debconf template
    description (Closes: #77157)
  * Updated TODO list
  * Strip entire path from .deb pathnames for the progress display, not
    just /var/cache/apt/archives.  This accounts for systems accessing a
    local mirror via apt (Closes: #77158)

 -- Matt Zimmerman <mdz@debian.org>  Wed, 15 Nov 2000 23:46:33 -0500

apt-listchanges (1.4) unstable; urgency=low

  * Updated TODO list
  * Updated Standards-Version (no changes necessary)

 -- Matt Zimmerman <mdz@debian.org>  Sat, 11 Nov 2000 15:56:55 -0500

apt-listchanges (1.3) unstable; urgency=low

  * Make sure we read the entire changelog (even if it is not displayed)
    to avoid a 'broken pipe' error when closing the pipe on a long
    changelog (first noticed with xext 3.3.6-12)
  * Removed extra space at the left margin of the description (thanks,
    lintian)
  * Enhanced description.

 -- Matt Zimmerman <mdz@debian.org>  Sat,  4 Nov 2000 20:55:51 -0500

apt-listchanges (1.2) unstable; urgency=low

  * Change maintainer email address

 -- Matt Zimmerman <mdz@debian.org>  Wed,  1 Nov 2000 22:34:52 -0500

apt-listchanges (1.1) unstable; urgency=low

  * Added debconf support.
  * Optionally add ourselves to /etc/apt/apt.conf when installed, and
    remove when we are removed.

 -- Matt Zimmerman <mdz@csh.rit.edu>  Wed, 18 Oct 2000 19:48:53 -0400

apt-listchanges (1.0) unstable; urgency=low

  * Package renamed to apt-listchanges

 -- Matt Zimmerman <mdz@csh.rit.edu>  Wed, 18 Oct 2000 18:15:48 -0400

debchanges (0.13) unstable; urgency=low

  * Check for packages whose source package version differs from the
    binary package version, and do the right thing.
  * Added a cancel button (causes exit with nonzero status).
  * Fixed a bug in the source package check that caused packages to be
    skipped when they shouldn't have been

 -- Matt Zimmerman <mdz@csh.rit.edu>  Tue, 17 Oct 2000 01:40:43 -0400

debchanges (0.12) unstable; urgency=low

  * It is not an error if --apt is specified and no package files are sent
    to stdin.

 -- Matt Zimmerman <mdz@csh.rit.edu>  Sun,  8 Oct 2000 23:09:26 -0400

debchanges (0.11) unstable; urgency=low

  * Only process one binary package from each source package (changelogs
    should be the same)

 -- Matt Zimmerman <mdz@csh.rit.edu>  Wed, 27 Sep 2000 14:19:39 -0700

debchanges (0.10) unstable; urgency=low

  * Fixed a bug that caused an empty dialog to be displayed (thanks to
    Matthias Klose <doko@cs.tu-berlin.de>>
  * Set Architecture: all (oops)

 -- Matt Zimmerman <mdz@csh.rit.edu>  Sat, 23 Sep 2000 02:43:46 -0400
