apt-listchanges (2.52) unstable; urgency=low

  * Danish translation of debconf templates from Claus Hindsgaul <claus_h@image.dk>
    (Closes: #239201)
  * Update description to reflect news capabilities (Closes: #240786)
  * When upgrading from 2.51 or earlier, seed the apt-listchanges/which
    debconf question to "both", rather than the new default of "news", so
    that users upgrading from older versions get the old default, while
    new users get the new default

apt-listchanges (2.51) unstable; urgency=low

  * Restore lost built-in default for frontend; this broke command-line
    invocation  (Closes: #237879)

 -- Matt Zimmerman <mdz@debian.org>  Sat, 13 Mar 2004 16:05:59 -0800

apt-listchanges (2.50) unstable; urgency=low

  * Update debhelper compatibility level to 4 and remove debian/conffiles
  * Use debian/compat rather than DH_COMPAT
  * Standards-Version: 3.6.1 (no changes needed)
  * Add new debconf question to ask whether to display news, changelogs or
    both.  Ask it at low priority, and default to news (Closes: #222362)
  * Adjust priorities and defaults of debconf questions to be less
    intrusive, and oriented towards a wider range of users:
    - Reduce priority of apt-listchanges/save-seen to low (almost
      everybody seems to want the default)
    - Reduce priority of apt-listchanges/email-address to low
      (still mails root by default; scream if you think this should remain
      medium)
    - Reduce priority of apt-listchanges/confirm to low, and change the
      default to false (no confirmation prompt)
    - End result: an installation at priority medium or higher will
      ask only one question (apt-listchanges/frontend), and display only
      NEWS.Debian items to the user on upgrades, with no confirmation
      prompt.  Feedback welcome.
  * Minor clarifications to some templates based on display of news as
    well as changelogs.  Mostly s/changelogs/changes/
  * With these changes, I think apt-listchanges would be suitable for
    priority: standard

apt-listchanges (2.49) unstable; urgency=low

  * Implement a --profile= command line option to select between different

  * Get rid of the --version command line option; I always forgot to
    update it and am too lazy to make it automatic
  * Updated Finnish translation of debconf templates from Tommi
    Vainikainen <thv+debian@iki.fi> (Closes: #226851)

    catalog from "Carlos Z.F. Liu" <carlos_liu@yahoo.com>

  * Make the frontends more customizable by passing in data from the
    config file.  You can specify a pager for the pager frontend, a
    terminal emulator for the xterm frontend, a web browser for the
    browser frontend (Closes: #206811), or an email address to mail
    changelogs to (Closes: #203395)
  * Print a brief message letting the user know what's going on when
    aborting based on the confirmation prompt (Closes: #202210)
  * Handle the KeyboardInterrupt exception (Closes: #139265)

apt-listchanges (2.43) unstable; urgency=low

  * Clean up a bunch of pending stuff so that some new development can begin
  * Fix the documentation to reflect the removal of support for
    apt-listchanges-specific BROWSER environment variables; this is all
    done in the usual way now, using sensible-browser.
  * Updated Polish translation of debconf templates from Bartosz
    Zapalowski <bartek@klepisko.eu.org> (Closes: #208956)

  * Updated Dutch translation of debconf templates from cobaco
    <cobaco@linux.be> (Closes: #204700)
  * Updated Spanish man page from cvs.d.o/manpages/spanish
    (Closes: #203763)
  * Python 2.3 now provides secure temporary files with names.  This means
    that we don't need to do any more pipe tricks to pass things into
    xterm, and we can get rid of the browser-pipe script.  Depends: python
    (>= 2.3)
    - This also happens to fix some problems with non-xterm terminal
      emulators such as rxvt, which closed our pipe fd on use
      (Closes: #205323)

apt-listchanges (2.39) unstable; urgency=low

  * Ignore changelog files which don't look like Debian changelogs.  This
    will provide a nicer failure condition for situations like #161325,
    where changelog data is not actually available (but we previously
    thought it was)
  * Don't display NEWS headers in the case where a NEWS.Debian was present
    but contained no news (Closes: #202143)

 -- Matt Zimmerman <mdz@debian.org>  Tue, 29 Jul 2003 19:42:46 -0400

apt-listchanges (2.38) unstable; urgency=low

  * Add Spanish man page from Ruben Porras <nahoo82@telefonica.net>
    (Closes: #195445)
  * Handle the case where a package contains multiple changelogs in
    different subdirectories of /usr/share/doc(!).  e2fsprogs does this:
    it Provides: libcomerr2 and libss2 and contains
    /usr/share/doc/{libcomerr2,libss2}/changelog.Debian.gz.  I have no
    idea why it does this, but there could be others, and it is easy
    enough to work around.  Take the first one which we can open
    successfully (Closes: #201152)

  * Fix urgency sorting (forgot to commit this for 2.36)
  * Fix a few small buglets (--which option and headers mode) from 2.36's
    reorg, spotted by Joe Drew
  * Add a bit about NEWS.Debian to the man page, courtesy of Joe Drew
  * Update man page to reflect /usr/share/doc as the standard location for
    the changelog
  * Move browser-pipe into /usr/share/apt-listchanges

 -- Matt Zimmerman <mdz@debian.org>  Mon,  7 Jul 2003 19:12:02 -0400

apt-listchanges (2.36) unstable; urgency=low

  * Refactor lots of code, with many tangible benefits
    - Make only a single pass through the deb, extracting all files we
      might be interested in, no matter how many different files we are
      interested in.  This makes searching for NEWS.Debian free, and speeds
      up processing of packages with only native changelogs (no
      changelog.Debian
    - OOPify several interfaces
    - Use the gzip module rather than forking zcat (faster and cleaner)
  * Add 'which' option to specify whether news, changelogs or both should
    be displayed.  This is still very primitive and everything is
    concatenated together.
  * Simplify urgency sorting
  * Remove import from __future__ which is unnecessary now that we require
    python 2.2 anyway

 -- Matt Zimmerman <mdz@debian.org>  Mon,  7 Jul 2003 01:31:03 -0400

apt-listchanges (2.35) unstable; urgency=low

  * Experimental NEWS.Debian support, based on a patch from Joe Drew.
    NEWS.Debian has the same format as changelog.  Currently the only
    difference is that the NEWS.Debian entries for all packages are
    displayed ahead of any changelog entries.  In the future, there will
    likely be an option to display only NEWS entries and skip changelogs,
    and different frontends will be able to display the news differently
    (Closes: #192089)

  * "Abort abort abort!"
  * Give up trying to properly encode the character set of the subjects of
    emails we send out.  Pretend everything is OK.  (Closes: #180823)
  * This reopens #159122 (Subject is not encoded properly), but since it's
    archived, we'll call it #199318 now.
  * Make sure we overwrite the entire progress message when finished
    (Closes: #199268)
  * Use cStringIO to build up the big string for the HTML frontend.  This
    should make it much faster with large strings (Closes: #186561)

apt-listchanges (2.28) unstable; urgency=low

  * Use a shell variable named something other than BROWSER in the
    browser-pipe script, so that it doesn't clobber a BROWSER environment
    variable and cause sensible-browser to call itself recursively.
    Isn't the bourne shell wonderful?
    (Closes: #179366)
  * Use the current locale's character set to encode the Subject header of
    email messages.  Hopefully this matches the character set used by
    gettext, because gettext doesn't seem to want to tell me what it's
    using

    the same thing in an xterm in the background.  (Closes: #82360)
  * Only works with w3m for now, because that is the only browser that I

apt-listchanges (2.13) unstable; urgency=low

  * Minor cosmetic changes to the progress indicators to make them more
    uniform and closer to apt's (Closes: #137736)
  * Be more conservative about the user's answer to the confirmation
    question (Closes: #137804)

 -- Matt Zimmerman <mdz@debian.org>  Wed, 20 Mar 2002 23:07:07 -0500

apt-listchanges (2.12) unstable; urgency=low

  * Updated Spanish translation from David Martinez Moreno
    <ender@debian.org>
  * Skip the question about confirmation if the 'mail' or 'none' frontend
    is chosen (Closes: #137241)

 -- Matt Zimmerman <mdz@debian.org>  Thu,  7 Mar 2002 22:04:35 -0500

apt-listchanges (2.11) unstable; urgency=low

  * Skip packages which are being removed (Closes: #135166)
  * Print newline to stderr instead of stdout in the text frontend
    (Closes: #136381)

 -- Matt Zimmerman <mdz@debian.org>  Fri,  1 Mar 2002 20:27:44 -0500

apt-listchanges (2.10) unstable; urgency=low

  * Fix a reversed urgency test which caused incorrect sorting when
    multiple versions with different urgencies were included in the same
    changelog display (Closes: #134345)

 -- Matt Zimmerman <mdz@debian.org>  Sun, 17 Feb 2002 00:16:27 -0500

apt-listchanges (2.9) unstable; urgency=low

  * Don't show a harmless error message when the config file does not
    exist (Closes: #134218)
  * Remove .pyc files in prerm (part of #133306)
  * Don't save the seen database until the user confirms the changes and
    mail has been sent (Closes: #108718)

apt-listchanges (2.8) unstable; urgency=low

  * Fix a bug which broke xterm-pager which was introduced when
    reorganizing the frontends (Closes: #133068)

 -- Matt Zimmerman <mdz@debian.org>  Sat,  9 Feb 2002 13:36:27 -0500

apt-listchanges (2.7) unstable; urgency=low

  * Updated Finnish translations of debconf templates and message catalogs
    from Jaakko Kangasharju <ashar@iki.fi>

apt-listchanges (2.6) unstable; urgency=low

    extracting the deb, mangled the changelog for the tar package
    (Closes: #132046)
  * Updated Spanish and Catalan translations of debconf templates and
    message catalogs from Jordi Mallach <jordi@debian.org>

 -- Matt Zimmerman <mdz@debian.org>  Sun,  3 Feb 2002 14:45:10 -0500

apt-listchanges (2.5) unstable; urgency=low

  * Start using python-apt (only version comparisons so far).  This gives
    a significant performance improvement, around 10%
  * Send mail after displaying changelogs, rather than before
  * Fix some funny business with the progress indicator
  * More translation updates, though things still aren't up to date
  * Reference /usr/sbin/sendmail instead of /usr/lib/sendmail
    (Closes: #132028)

 -- Matt Zimmerman <mdz@debian.org>  Sun,  3 Feb 2002 03:40:55 -0500

apt-listchanges (2.4) unstable; urgency=low

  * Add back the 'mail' frontend, so that 'none' can continue to mean
    "don't even look for changelogs". (Closes: #129991, #129794)
  * Add an error message for an unknown frontend (Closes: #129993)
  * Fix --help, usage() was lost when moving code to the module
    (Closes: #129992)
  * Get rid of the hackish 'run' configuration option, since frontend=none
    accomplishes the same purpose
  * Update the debconf templates to reflect several minor configuration
    differences

 -- Matt Zimmerman <mdz@debian.org>  Sat, 19 Jan 2002 17:09:16 -0500

apt-listchanges (2.3) unstable; urgency=low

  * Add 'none' option to apt-listchanges/frontend template
    (Closes: #129325)
  * Added back some things that shouldn't have been removed from po/Makefile
  * Regenerate po/*.po and po/apt-listchanges.pot to make translators'
    lives easier

 -- Matt Zimmerman <mdz@debian.org>  Tue, 15 Jan 2002 19:20:19 -0500

apt-listchanges (2.2) unstable; urgency=low

  * Clean up po/Makefile a bit
  * gettextize some messages that were overlooked, and update Catalan
    templates, both thanks to Jordi Mallach <jordi@debian.org>
  * Fix instantiation of gettext classes (Closes: #129123)
  * Update Estonian translations of message catalogs, thanks to Ivar
    Smolin <okul@linux.ee>
  * Do what the documentation says we should do when email_address ==
    'none'. (Closes: #129150)

 -- Matt Zimmerman <mdz@debian.org>  Mon, 14 Jan 2002 03:58:39 -0500

apt-listchanges (2.1) unstable; urgency=low

  * On upgrade, remove /var/lib/apt/listchanges.db instead of truncating
    it
  * Fix a problem with parsing the APT configuration data in the pipeline
    (Closes: #129088)

 -- Matt Zimmerman <mdz@debian.org>  Sun, 13 Jan 2002 20:37:28 -0500

apt-listchanges (2.0) unstable; urgency=low

  * The Python release
  * Complete rewrite in python, and lots of code cleanup
  * ATTENTION: The configuration file format has changed, it now uses
    python's ConfigParser.  Folks configuring based on the debconf
    questions should be migrated automagically.  Others will need to RTFM.
  * The newt frontend is gone, and good riddance.  Try the pager frontend,
    fix newt, or send me a patch for something better.
    (Closes: #78814, #94572, #126055)
  * Mail can now be sent in addition to running one of the usual
    frontends, using --email-address=me@there.  If this option is not
    specified, no mail is sent.  An argument of 'none' overrides a
    configured default. (Closes: #78448)
  * --nosaveseen is gone.  --saveseen now accepts an argument, which is
    the database file to use, so you can use different databases for
    different tasks.  --saveseen=none will act like the old --nosaveseen.
  * Get rid of the automake cruft and just do it by hand.  Automake was
    starting to do way too much unnecessary work
  * Document the config file format
  * Since this was as much a redesign as a rewrite, it is possible that an
    old bug or two may have crept back in; some of the logic is fragile
    due to lax standardization of certain aspects of Debian packaging.  I
    have squashed a few already as I have noticed them.  Send in those bug
    reports for ones that I may have missed.

 -- Matt Zimmerman <mdz@debian.org>  Sun, 13 Jan 2002 03:17:16 -0500

apt-listchanges (1.61) unstable; urgency=low

 -- Matt Zimmerman <mdz@debian.org>  Mon, 17 Dec 2001 20:24:04 -0500

apt-listchanges (1.60) unstable; urgency=low

  * Added a --debug option to help with debugging future problems
  * Work around tar's ridiculous globbing, so that we don't pick up things
    that look like changelogs but are in a subdirectory of .../doc
    (Closes: #118382)

 -- Matt Zimmerman <mdz@debian.org>  Thu, 13 Dec 2001 04:20:30 -0500

apt-listchanges (1.58) unstable; urgency=low

  * Be sure to return a true value from the xterm-pager initialization
    routine, thanks to Charles C.Fu <ccwf@bacchus.com> (Closes: #114245)
  * Updated Catalan translation from Jordi Mallach <jordi@debian.org>

 -- Matt Zimmerman <mdz@debian.org>  Wed, 17 Oct 2001 15:59:26 -0400

apt-listchanges (1.57) unstable; urgency=low

  * Don't get confused when there are no changelog entries for the
    newly-installed version of a package.  This should never happen, of
    course, but it just did with cracklib2.

 -- Matt Zimmerman <mdz@debian.org>  Thu,  6 Sep 2001 20:10:04 -0400

apt-listchanges (1.56) unstable; urgency=low

  * Updated Galician translation of Debconf templates from Jacobo Tarrio

apt-listchanges (1.55) unstable; urgency=low

  * Add fallback from xterm-pager to pager (Closes: #107211)
  * Fallback from pager->text, not pager->mail (what was I thinking?)
  * Rename apt.conf.d/20-apt-listchanges.conf to apt.conf.d/20listchanges
    to meet the new filename restrictions in apt 0.5.4 (Closes: #109784)
  * Build-depend on autoconf >= 2.50-1, and run autoconf2.50, to work with
    the latest libtool

 -- Matt Zimmerman <mdz@debian.org>  Sat, 25 Aug 2001 18:12:39 -0400

apt-listchanges (1.54) unstable; urgency=low

  * Fix various harmless Perl warnings (Closes: #106047)
  * No longer ship with #!/usr/bin/perl -w; it's more trouble than it's
    worth in the wild.
  * Do a secondary sort on package name after the upload urgency sort
    (Closes: #106045)

 -- Matt Zimmerman <mdz@debian.org>  Sat, 21 Jul 2001 17:46:03 -0400

apt-listchanges (1.53) unstable; urgency=low

  * Added a feature to keep track of which changelogs have already been
    seen by the user, and accompanying debconf question, config file
    option, and command line option. (Closes: #77161, #103537)
  * A respectable bit of code cleanup.  A rewrite is probably called for,
    perhaps in a different language.  We'll wait and see.
  * Remember to read all of the pipeline data when using the 'none'
    frontend (Closes: #105701)

 -- Matt Zimmerman <mdz@debian.org>  Tue, 17 Jul 2001 18:08:16 -0400

apt-listchanges (1.52) unstable; urgency=low

  * Added support for APT_LISTCHANGES_FRONTEND environment variable to
    allow easy frontend selection when apt-listchanges is being called by
    another program.
  * Added a new, snazzy frontend called 'none' which will cause
    apt-listchanges to exit without doing anything.
  * These two features can be used together to skip the changelogs for a
    particular run. (Closes: #77988, #105423)

 -- Matt Zimmerman <mdz@debian.org>  Sun, 15 Jul 2001 22:36:03 -0400

apt-listchanges (1.51) unstable; urgency=low

  * Fix to work with .debs created by older versions of dpkg-dev
    (Closes: #100975)

apt-listchanges (1.50) unstable; urgency=low

apt-listchanges (1.49) unstable; urgency=low

  * Fix a bogus error when installing a package from scratch, appeared in
    1.48.

 -- Matt Zimmerman <mdz@debian.org>  Wed, 23 May 2001 16:52:27 -0400

apt-listchanges (1.48) unstable; urgency=low

  * Updated Galician translation of debconf templates, thanks to Jacobo
    Tarrio <jtarrio@trasno.net>
  * Read .debs in the order in which apt will configure them.  This lets
    us find changelogs in the new perl, and may speed things up a bit for
    packages where .../doc/foo -> bar and foo Depends: bar.
    (Closes: #98442)
  * Fix up Makefile.in to work with the latest automake.  Use _SCRIPTS
    instead of _PROGRAMS, which I should have probably done in the first
    place.

 -- Matt Zimmerman <mdz@debian.org>  Tue, 22 May 2001 21:29:39 -0400

apt-listchanges (1.47) unstable; urgency=low

  * Add Estonian translation of message catalogs, thanks to Ivar Smolin
    <okul@linux.ee>
  * Make sure we read all of the piped data from apt, even if we are just
    going to exit because we won't do anything.  If we don't, apt thinks
    we broke. (Closes: #96114)

 -- Matt Zimmerman <mdz@debian.org>  Wed,  2 May 2001 18:14:40 -0400

apt-listchanges (1.46) unstable; urgency=low

  * Copy in the latest po/Makefile.in.in from gettext (Closes: #94750)

 -- Matt Zimmerman <mdz@debian.org>  Tue, 24 Apr 2001 11:52:48 -0400

apt-listchanges (1.45) unstable; urgency=low

  * Skip "Local variables" section at end of changelog.  Really, this
    should never show up anyway, since we won't usually be displaying the
    last entry in the changelog.  It seems to come up anyway, usually
    during weird package splits/merges and the like. (Closes: #93332)
  * Still read the status file, even if we are getting some information
    from the apt pipeline.  apt doesn't give us the source package
    version, which we need to do our job.  Darn. (Closes: #93790)
  * Miscellaneous fixes to work with the most recent automake

 -- Matt Zimmerman <mdz@debian.org>  Fri, 13 Apr 2001 19:05:55 -0400

apt-listchanges (1.44) unstable; urgency=low

  * Added Galician translation of debconf templates, thanks to Jacobo
    Tarrio <jtarrio@iname.com>
  * Updated Galician translation of message catalog, thanks to Jacobo
    Tarrio <jtarrio@iname.com>
  * Give a more sensible error message if the user specifies something
    other than .deb archives on the command line (Closes: #92058)

 -- Matt Zimmerman <mdz@debian.org>  Thu, 29 Mar 2001 03:29:15 -0500

apt-listchanges (1.43) unstable; urgency=low

  * Added --version and --help options (Closes: #90929)
  * Automatically substitute package version from changelog into
    configure.in, so that it doesn't fall out of sync when I forget to
    update it.

 -- Matt Zimmerman <mdz@debian.org>  Sun, 25 Mar 2001 02:20:42 -0500

apt-listchanges (1.42) unstable; urgency=low

  * Added Finnish translation of message catalog, thanks to Jaakko
    Kangasharju <ashar@iki.fi>
  * Make urgency comparison case insensitive (to deal with urgency values
    like HIGH, used by a recent xfree86 upload).  This caused "Use of
    uninitialized value" warnings when such a value was encountered.

 -- Matt Zimmerman <mdz@debian.org>  Tue, 20 Mar 2001 20:08:19 -0500

apt-listchanges (1.41) unstable; urgency=low

  * Fixed an uninitialized value warning in the newt frontend

 -- Matt Zimmerman <mdz@debian.org>  Sat, 17 Mar 2001 23:09:50 -0500

apt-listchanges (1.40) unstable; urgency=low

  * Don't display the per-package headers by default, as they can get in
    the way of an easy visual scan.  Instead, they can be turned on using
    the -h or --headers command line options.  Edit
    /etc/apt/apt.conf.d/20-apt-listchanges.conf and add the option there
    if you want the headers back. (Closes: #89821)
  * Add missing build-dependency on the new perl

 -- Matt Zimmerman <mdz@debian.org>  Thu, 15 Mar 2001 23:33:43 -0500

apt-listchanges (1.39) unstable; urgency=low

  * Prevent an obscure warning that only happened if apt-listchanges was
    run unconfigured.
  * Fix urgency sorting (broken in 1.36, I think)

 -- Matt Zimmerman <mdz@debian.org>  Thu, 15 Mar 2001 01:21:22 -0500

apt-listchanges (1.38) unstable; urgency=low

  * The text frontend will no longer display a progress indicator, so that
    its output can be usefully redirected to a file.
  * If APT::quiet has been set (e.g. by apt-get -q), apt-listchanges will
    force the text frontend to be used, so that apt-get -q output will be
    loggable.
  * Closes: #89511

 -- Matt Zimmerman <mdz@debian.org>  Tue, 13 Mar 2001 17:25:04 -0500

apt-listchanges (1.37) unstable; urgency=low

  * Parse the urgency value correctly, even when there are multiple
    key/value pairs in the changelog header (Closes: #89492)

 -- Matt Zimmerman <mdz@debian.org>  Tue, 13 Mar 2001 07:43:00 -0500

apt-listchanges (1.36) unstable; urgency=low

  * Show which binary packages relate to the source packages for which
    changes are being displayed (Closes: #85572)
  * Now -w clean, as far as I can determine.  This may cause some warnings
    to be displayed under certain circumstances now; I will try to fix
    them as they come up.

 -- Matt Zimmerman <mdz@debian.org>  Sun, 11 Mar 2001 03:27:03 -0500

apt-listchanges (1.35) unstable; urgency=low

  * Added Galician translation of message catalogs, thanks to Jacobo
    Tarrio <jtarrio@iname.com>
  * Modify apt.conf snippet to sanitize the exit code, so we don't cause
    apt to abort unless we really want to. (Closes: #88784)
  
 -- Matt Zimmerman <mdz@debian.org>  Sat, 10 Mar 2001 00:05:08 -0500

apt-listchanges (1.34) unstable; urgency=low

  * We now interface with apt by dropping a conffile in
    /etc/apt/apt.conf.d.  This allows us to avoid sharing a config file
    with anyone else, and to have a defined execution order in relation
    to, e.g. dpkg-preconfigure.
  * debian/control: depend on apt (>= 0.5.3)
  * debian/control: depend on debconf (this should have been there long
    ago)
  * debian/rules: install /etc/apt/apt.conf.d/20-apt-listchanges.conf
  * debian/postinst: updated for apt 0.5 (no more apt.conf hackery!)
  * debian/postinst: added apt-mode-run config option, necessary for the
    new way of interfacing with apt
  * apt-listchanges.in: added apt-mode-run config option
  * Added Spanish translation of message catalogs, thanks to Jordi Mallach

apt-listchanges (1.19) unstable; urgency=low

  * Change the name and meaning of the config file variable 'confirm' so
    that it only applies to apt mode.  A config file default for this

  * Clean up old debconf questions that we don't ask anymore

 -- Matt Zimmerman <mdz@debian.org>  Tue, 19 Dec 2000 23:15:38 -0500

apt-listchanges (1.18) unstable; urgency=low

  * Clarify and extend man page (Closes: #79698)

 -- Matt Zimmerman <mdz@debian.org>  Tue, 19 Dec 2000 00:58:08 -0500

apt-listchanges (1.17) unstable; urgency=low

  * Only ask for confirmation if there were changes to display

 -- Matt Zimmerman <mdz@debian.org>  Wed, 13 Dec 2000 16:58:27 -0500

apt-listchanges (1.16) unstable; urgency=low

  * Fix bug that caused apt-listchanges to run if no packages were being
    installed, only removed (Closes: #79479)

 -- Matt Zimmerman <mdz@debian.org>  Tue, 12 Dec 2000 19:03:06 -0500

apt-listchanges (1.15) unstable; urgency=low

  * All interactive frontends now have the option of asking the user
    whether or not to continue, in a way appropriate for the selected
    frontend.  Right now, this is a simple text prompt for all of them.
    (Closes: #78552)
  * Configuration file moved to /etc/apt/listchanges.conf
  * Renamed debconf variables to suit their actual use (which turned out
    to be different from their intended one).  This will cause all
    questions to get asked again, but since there is a new question to ask
    anyway, nobody should mind too much.
  * Some support for the new apt (0.4), which gives us a lot more information
    in the pipeline in addition to the .deb filenames.  This means that we
    won't have to read the status file anymore.  There is also a newer and
    better way to configure our hook into apt, but we can't use it until
    there is a new released version of apt to Depend on.

 -- Matt Zimmerman <mdz@debian.org>  Sun, 10 Dec 2000 00:22:12 -0500

apt-listchanges (1.14) unstable; urgency=low

  * Only skip based on the source package name if we actually got changelogs
    from another binary package with the same source package.  This fixes
    a problem when processing multi-binary packages which symlink
    subdirectories in /usr/share/doc (e.g. xmms/xmms-dev).

 -- Matt Zimmerman <mdz@debian.org>  Thu, 30 Nov 2000 04:56:49 -0500

apt-listchanges (1.13) unstable; urgency=low

  * Don't send empty messages when using the mail frontend (Closes: #77993)

 -- Matt Zimmerman <mdz@debian.org>  Mon, 27 Nov 2000 14:37:22 -0500

apt-listchanges (1.12) unstable; urgency=low

  * Make newt optional.  We only load it if the user is using the newt
    frontend, and fail with an informative message if it's unavailable.
    This also means we now Suggest newt, rather than depending on it, and
    it is no longer the default in debconf.  All you pager users can purge
    libnewt-perl and libnewt0 now.
  * Include the hostname when using the mail frontend (Closes: #77588)

 -- Matt Zimmerman <mdz@debian.org>  Tue, 21 Nov 2000 00:01:15 -0500

apt-listchanges (1.11) unstable; urgency=low

  * Always ignore the return value of the pager program...it's too
    unpredictable to use for making a decision.  I would like for the user
    to have some way to tell apt-listchanges to abort when using the pager
    frontend, but I'll have to find another way.  Once again, this
    hopefully Closes: #77421.
  * The patch to order changelog entries by urgency slipped out of 1.10.
    The functionality should be there now (Closes: #77420)

 -- Matt Zimmerman <mdz@debian.org>  Mon, 20 Nov 2000 19:58:12 -0500

apt-listchanges (1.10) unstable; urgency=low

  * Order changelog entries by urgency (Closes: #77420)

 -- Matt Zimmerman <mdz@debian.org>  Sun, 19 Nov 2000 04:21:16 -0500

apt-listchanges (1.9) unstable; urgency=low

  * Remember to catch SIGPIPE when using the pager frontend
    (Closes: #77421)

 -- Matt Zimmerman <mdz@debian.org>  Sun, 19 Nov 2000 03:40:24 -0500

apt-listchanges (1.8) unstable; urgency=low

  * Documented frontend and email-address options in manpage, corrected
    program name in manpage.

 -- Matt Zimmerman <mdz@debian.org>  Sat, 18 Nov 2000 04:46:52 -0500

apt-listchanges (1.7) unstable; urgency=low

  * Multiple frontend support added.  You can now choose to view
    changelogs with a pager, a simple text dump, via email, or with the
    old newt interface (Closes: #77186)
  * Remember to include the TODO list (oops)

 -- Matt Zimmerman <mdz@debian.org>  Sat, 18 Nov 2000 00:10:12 -0500

apt-listchanges (1.6) unstable; urgency=low

  * Remember to remove ourselves from apt.conf if we are reconfigured
    using dpkg-reconfigure
  * Resize ourselves properly (Closes: #77236)

 -- Matt Zimmerman <mdz@debian.org>  Thu, 16 Nov 2000 18:12:31 -0500

apt-listchanges (1.5) unstable; urgency=low

  * Fixed a bug that would read the wrong changelog for Debian
    native packages (notably dpkg) which have both a changelog.gz and
    changelog.Debian.gz.
  * Use only one piece of whitespace to indent the debconf template
    description (Closes: #77157)
  * Updated TODO list
  * Strip entire path from .deb pathnames for the progress display, not
    just /var/cache/apt/archives.  This accounts for systems accessing a
    local mirror via apt (Closes: #77158)

 -- Matt Zimmerman <mdz@debian.org>  Wed, 15 Nov 2000 23:46:33 -0500

apt-listchanges (1.4) unstable; urgency=low

  * Updated TODO list
  * Updated Standards-Version (no changes necessary)

 -- Matt Zimmerman <mdz@debian.org>  Sat, 11 Nov 2000 15:56:55 -0500

apt-listchanges (1.3) unstable; urgency=low

  * Make sure we read the entire changelog (even if it is not displayed)
    to avoid a 'broken pipe' error when closing the pipe on a long
    changelog (first noticed with xext 3.3.6-12)
  * Removed extra space at the left margin of the description (thanks,
    lintian)
  * Enhanced description.

 -- Matt Zimmerman <mdz@debian.org>  Sat,  4 Nov 2000 20:55:51 -0500

apt-listchanges (1.2) unstable; urgency=low

  * Change maintainer email address

 -- Matt Zimmerman <mdz@debian.org>  Wed,  1 Nov 2000 22:34:52 -0500

apt-listchanges (1.1) unstable; urgency=low

  * Added debconf support.
  * Optionally add ourselves to /etc/apt/apt.conf when installed, and
    remove when we are removed.

 -- Matt Zimmerman <mdz@csh.rit.edu>  Wed, 18 Oct 2000 19:48:53 -0400

apt-listchanges (1.0) unstable; urgency=low

  * Package renamed to apt-listchanges

 -- Matt Zimmerman <mdz@csh.rit.edu>  Wed, 18 Oct 2000 18:15:48 -0400

debchanges (0.13) unstable; urgency=low

  * Check for packages whose source package version differs from the
    binary package version, and do the right thing.
  * Added a cancel button (causes exit with nonzero status).
  * Fixed a bug in the source package check that caused packages to be
    skipped when they shouldn't have been

 -- Matt Zimmerman <mdz@csh.rit.edu>  Tue, 17 Oct 2000 01:40:43 -0400

debchanges (0.12) unstable; urgency=low

  * It is not an error if --apt is specified and no package files are sent
    to stdin.

 -- Matt Zimmerman <mdz@csh.rit.edu>  Sun,  8 Oct 2000 23:09:26 -0400

debchanges (0.11) unstable; urgency=low

  * Only process one binary package from each source package (changelogs
    should be the same)

 -- Matt Zimmerman <mdz@csh.rit.edu>  Wed, 27 Sep 2000 14:19:39 -0700

debchanges (0.10) unstable; urgency=low

  * Fixed a bug that caused an empty dialog to be displayed (thanks to
    Matthias Klose <doko@cs.tu-berlin.de>>
  * Set Architecture: all (oops)

 -- Matt Zimmerman <mdz@csh.rit.edu>  Sat, 23 Sep 2000 02:43:46 -0400
