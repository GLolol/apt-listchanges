apt-listchanges (1.18) unstable; urgency=low

  * Clarify and extend man page (Closes: #79698)

 -- Matt Zimmerman <mdz@debian.org>  Tue, 19 Dec 2000 00:58:08 -0500

apt-listchanges (1.17) unstable; urgency=low

  * Only ask for confirmation if there were changes to display

 -- Matt Zimmerman <mdz@debian.org>  Wed, 13 Dec 2000 16:58:27 -0500

apt-listchanges (1.16) unstable; urgency=low

  * Fix bug that caused apt-listchanges to run if no packages were being
    installed, only removed (Closes: #79479)

 -- Matt Zimmerman <mdz@debian.org>  Tue, 12 Dec 2000 19:03:06 -0500

apt-listchanges (1.15) unstable; urgency=low

  * All interactive frontends now have the option of asking the user
    whether or not to continue, in a way appropriate for the selected
    frontend.  Right now, this is a simple text prompt for all of them.
    (Closes: #78552)
  * Configuration file moved to /etc/apt/listchanges.conf
  * Renamed debconf variables to suit their actual use (which turned out
    to be different from their intended one).  This will cause all
    questions to get asked again, but since there is a new question to ask
    anyway, nobody should mind too much.
  * Some support for the new apt (0.4), which gives us a lot more information
    in the pipeline in addition to the .deb filenames.  This means that we
    won't have to read the status file anymore.  There is also a newer and
    better way to configure our hook into apt, but we can't use it until
    there is a new released version of apt to Depend on.

apt-listchanges (1.14) unstable; urgency=low

  * Only skip based on the source package name if we actually got changelogs
    from another binary package with the same source package.  This fixes
    a problem when processing multi-binary packages which symlink
    subdirectories in /usr/share/doc (e.g. xmms/xmms-dev).

 -- Matt Zimmerman <mdz@debian.org>  Thu, 30 Nov 2000 04:56:49 -0500

apt-listchanges (1.13) unstable; urgency=low

  * Don't send empty messages when using the mail frontend (Closes: #77993)

 -- Matt Zimmerman <mdz@debian.org>  Mon, 27 Nov 2000 14:37:22 -0500

apt-listchanges (1.12) unstable; urgency=low

  * Make newt optional.  We only load it if the user is using the newt
    frontend, and fail with an informative message if it's unavailable.
    This also means we now Suggest newt, rather than depending on it, and
    it is no longer the default in debconf.  All you pager users can purge
    libnewt-perl and libnewt0 now.
  * Include the hostname when using the mail frontend (Closes: #77588)

 -- Matt Zimmerman <mdz@debian.org>  Tue, 21 Nov 2000 00:01:15 -0500

apt-listchanges (1.11) unstable; urgency=low

  * Always ignore the return value of the pager program...it's too
    unpredictable to use for making a decision.  I would like for the user
    to have some way to tell apt-listchanges to abort when using the pager
    frontend, but I'll have to find another way.  Once again, this
    hopefully Closes: #77421.
  * The patch to order changelog entries by urgency slipped out of 1.10.
    The functionality should be there now (Closes: #77420)

 -- Matt Zimmerman <mdz@debian.org>  Mon, 20 Nov 2000 19:58:12 -0500

apt-listchanges (1.10) unstable; urgency=low

  * Order changelog entries by urgency (Closes: #77420)

 -- Matt Zimmerman <mdz@debian.org>  Sun, 19 Nov 2000 04:21:16 -0500

apt-listchanges (1.9) unstable; urgency=low

  * Remember to catch SIGPIPE when using the pager frontend
    (Closes: #77421)

 -- Matt Zimmerman <mdz@debian.org>  Sun, 19 Nov 2000 03:40:24 -0500

apt-listchanges (1.8) unstable; urgency=low

  * Documented frontend and email-address options in manpage, corrected
    program name in manpage.

 -- Matt Zimmerman <mdz@debian.org>  Sat, 18 Nov 2000 04:46:52 -0500

apt-listchanges (1.7) unstable; urgency=low

  * Multiple frontend support added.  You can now choose to view
    changelogs with a pager, a simple text dump, via email, or with the
    old newt interface (Closes: #77186)
  * Remember to include the TODO list (oops)

 -- Matt Zimmerman <mdz@debian.org>  Sat, 18 Nov 2000 00:10:12 -0500

apt-listchanges (1.6) unstable; urgency=low

  * Remember to remove ourselves from apt.conf if we are reconfigured
    using dpkg-reconfigure
  * Resize ourselves properly (Closes: #77236)

 -- Matt Zimmerman <mdz@debian.org>  Thu, 16 Nov 2000 18:12:31 -0500

apt-listchanges (1.5) unstable; urgency=low

  * Fixed a bug that would read the wrong changelog for Debian
    native packages (notably dpkg) which have both a changelog.gz and
    changelog.Debian.gz.
  * Use only one piece of whitespace to indent the debconf template
    description (Closes: #77157)
  * Updated TODO list
  * Strip entire path from .deb pathnames for the progress display, not
    just /var/cache/apt/archives.  This accounts for systems accessing a
    local mirror via apt (Closes: #77158)

 -- Matt Zimmerman <mdz@debian.org>  Wed, 15 Nov 2000 23:46:33 -0500

apt-listchanges (1.4) unstable; urgency=low

  * Updated TODO list
  * Updated Standards-Version (no changes necessary)

 -- Matt Zimmerman <mdz@debian.org>  Sat, 11 Nov 2000 15:56:55 -0500

apt-listchanges (1.3) unstable; urgency=low

  * Make sure we read the entire changelog (even if it is not displayed)
    to avoid a 'broken pipe' error when closing the pipe on a long
    changelog (first noticed with xext 3.3.6-12)
  * Removed extra space at the left margin of the description (thanks,
    lintian)
  * Enhanced description.

 -- Matt Zimmerman <mdz@debian.org>  Sat,  4 Nov 2000 20:55:51 -0500

apt-listchanges (1.2) unstable; urgency=low

  * Change maintainer email address

apt-listchanges (1.1) unstable; urgency=low

  * Added debconf support.
  * Optionally add ourselves to /etc/apt/apt.conf when installed, and
    remove when we are removed.

 -- Matt Zimmerman <mdz@csh.rit.edu>  Wed, 18 Oct 2000 19:48:53 -0400

apt-listchanges (1.0) unstable; urgency=low

  * Package renamed to apt-listchanges

 -- Matt Zimmerman <mdz@csh.rit.edu>  Wed, 18 Oct 2000 18:15:48 -0400

debchanges (0.13) unstable; urgency=low

  * Check for packages whose source package version differs from the
    binary package version, and do the right thing.
  * Added a cancel button (causes exit with nonzero status).
  * Fixed a bug in the source package check that caused packages to be
    skipped when they shouldn't have been

 -- Matt Zimmerman <mdz@csh.rit.edu>  Tue, 17 Oct 2000 01:40:43 -0400

debchanges (0.12) unstable; urgency=low

  * It is not an error if --apt is specified and no package files are sent
    to stdin.

 -- Matt Zimmerman <mdz@csh.rit.edu>  Sun,  8 Oct 2000 23:09:26 -0400

debchanges (0.11) unstable; urgency=low

  * Only process one binary package from each source package (changelogs
    should be the same)

 -- Matt Zimmerman <mdz@csh.rit.edu>  Wed, 27 Sep 2000 14:19:39 -0700

debchanges (0.10) unstable; urgency=low

  * Fixed a bug that caused an empty dialog to be displayed (thanks to
    Matthias Klose <doko@cs.tu-berlin.de>>
  * Set Architecture: all (oops)

 -- Matt Zimmerman <mdz@csh.rit.edu>  Sat, 23 Sep 2000 02:43:46 -0400
