- Should the progress dialog use newt, or a one-line status indicator
  a la debconf?

- For each source package processed, list the binary packages
  belonging to it that are in the list of packages to be installed
  (this means making a second pass over either the .debs or the
  changelog output)

- Accept (lists of) source packages as well as binary packages

- Accept (lists of) package names, and retrieve changelogs from
  get-changelog.cgi or similar (when it works)

- Changelogs are typically wrapped expecting an 80 character wide
  display.  Our dialog window is somewhat smaller.  Should
  apt-listchanges try to use a larger window?  This may work, but will
  be ugly and counter-intuitive.  For example, the scrollbar will not be
  visible.  Or should we try to re-wrap the text on-the-fly?

- Allow the user to choose a text display (using a pager), a terminal
  graphics display (like the current one), email
  notification...others?
