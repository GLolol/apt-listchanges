- Should the progress dialog use newt, or a one-line status indicator
  a la debconf?

- For each source package processed, list the binary packages
  belonging to it that are in the list of packages to be installed
  (this means making a second pass over either the .debs or the
  changelog output)

- Accept (lists of) source packages as well as binary packages

- Accept (lists of) package names, and retrieve changelogs from
  get-changelog.cgi or similar (when it works)
