- For each source package processed, list the binary packages
  belonging to it that are in the list of packages to be installed
  (this means making a second pass over either the .debs or the
  changelog output) (should be easy now with apt 0.5)

- Accept (lists of) source packages as well as binary packages

- Accept (lists of) package names, and retrieve changelogs from
  get-changelog.cgi or similar (when it works).  In order for this to
  really work in apt mode, we need for apt to implement wishlist bug
  #80123.

- Use dpkg-parsechangelog once it's fixed to accept piped/gzip input
  (bug #80142)

- Find a decent text menu frontend to supersede newt.

- Maybe rewrite the whole thing in C++, use libapt-pkg and provide a
  nice X frontend one day.  This could provide all of the navigation
  features that people have wanted (expand/collapse, hyperlinks, etc.)
