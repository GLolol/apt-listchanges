- For each source package processed, list the binary packages
  belonging to it that are in the list of packages to be installed
  (this means making a second pass over either the .debs or the
  changelog output)

- Hierarchical display for the newt frontend (wishlist bug #76500)

- Accept (lists of) source packages as well as binary packages

- Accept (lists of) package names, and retrieve changelogs from
  get-changelog.cgi or similar (when it works)

- Changelogs are typically wrapped expecting an 80 character wide
  display.  Our dialog window when using newt is somewhat smaller, if
  the terminal is 80 characters wide.  Should apt-listchanges try to use a
  larger window?  This may work, but will be ugly and counter-intuitive.
  For example, the scrollbar will not be visible.  Or should we try to
  re-wrap the text on-the-fly?

- Find a decent text menu frontend to supersede newt.  Try Term::Stool.
